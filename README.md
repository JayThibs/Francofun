This is a work-in-progress. A bulk of the work was completed within a 24-hour Hackathon. The goal of the Hackathon was to make an app that can be helpful to francophones using government data.

In 24 hours I:

- Came up with the idea for the app including the business plan.
- Created a Facebook login authentication with Firebase.
- Created the opening page of the app which gives users categories they can choose based on what they are looking for.
- Prep work for each category. Effectively, I was working on a code that could take in data from Firebase and list all the events near the user or ressources their child could use.
- Prepared the presentation for the app.

I am unsure whether I will continue working on the app, but it was a good experience all in all. I'm glad I was able to sharpen my Swift and Firebase skills.

Notes concerning the Hackathon itself: I did not win the Hackathon, but several judges came up to me after the event to say they loved my app and I came exceptionnaly close at winning. You could make a team at the Hackathon (the winning team was a group of 4 people, 2 of which have apps in the app store that are highly recommended by Apple and recently trended in Canada), but I chose to do it alone as I couldn't find anyone who could code with Swift and I wanted to improve my Swift skills. We were told what the Hackathon was about 4-5 weeks before the event and that we could start working on our app in advance. I started working on the app when the Hackathon began since I was busy completing my master's thesis.
